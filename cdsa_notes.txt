PPLs have a issue of data binding, and structuring the code in heirarchical design.
Thus, PP strategy creates the issues like Tight coupling
Difficult to create very big applications.

OOP came as the answer for the above issues.
IN OOP, we have the concepts like
A Abstraction	To hide the implementations make the user easy to use.
E Encapsulation	Better way of data and method binding (Access specifiers)	
I Inheritance	Better way of reusing the existing solutions
P Polymorphism	Applying modifications to the existing solution is easy

C++ was the 1st successful OOPL built on C
C++ = C + OOc
C++ is an increment to C

But C++ was not so high level and it was not machine independent language.

Java came as a better alternative to C++
More high level (Abstractions on Pointers, operator overloading, no global data, no hybrid inheritance)
Exception handling
By default multi threaded
Machine independent
Plug-ins can be easily created with help of Interfaces

STRUCTURE OF C PROGRAM
#include
other pre processors
struct union and enum definitions 
function declarations / prototype
function definitions / solution / instructions / business logic


The very existance use of programming and even a Computer for that matter, is 
DATA. So at the core of programming is DATA.
Data must be given at most priority.
There are different kind of data.
e.g. Numeric, alphabetic, alphanumeric, audio, image, video etc.
DATA-TYPE	"Type of the data"
Data types available in C are:
Numeric: int, float, double
alpha, alphanumeric: char, string
We also have manipulators
The 2 basic numeric data types:
int			4 bytes
double		8 bytes
Every data in memory of the computer has a fixed size (in terms of bytes)

float (half of double)	4 bytes (to store precision along with number)
Manipulators:
1. which changes the size
	short	can be applied only to int (so  short int   is 2 bytes)
	long	can be applied to int and double
So long int is 4 bytes,  long long int is 8 bytes and int is 4 bytes

2. which changes the sign
	signed		to store -ve or +ve numbers
	unsigned	to store only +ve numbers
Note: All variables by default are signed.

char		to store one ASCII character
char[]		to store a string (a word, or gorup of words) " "

LOOPS
for 			0 or N times (where N value is known)
while			0 or X times (Where X is unknown value)
do-while		1 or X times (Where X is unknown value)

CONDITIONAL
if		else	switch	case	default		break	continue	return
if(confition)
  then fo this.
  
if(confition)
	do this;
else
	do this;

if(c)
	if(c)
	
if(c1)
   if(c2)
     do this
   else if(3)
     do this
   else
     do this
else
   do this
   
if(finalYear)
   allow;
else if(pre )
     if(aggre > 70)
	    allow
else
    do not allow;
	
1. Check if a number is positive
2. Check if a number is Even
3. Check if a number is Even or Odd
4. Check if a character is upper case 
5. Check if a number is Perfect Square
6. Check if a person is eligible to vote on age basis
7. Check if a year is Leap year
8. Check if an alphabet is a Vowel
9. Check if a character is a digit or alphabet or a symbol
10. Check if a number is divisible by 5
11. Check if a number is 2 digit number
12. Find smallest of 2 numbers
13. Find biggest of 2 distinct numbers
14. Find smallest of 3 distinct numbers
---------------------------------------------------
Ralational Operators:
< > <= >= == !=
All are binary oprs
I/P are numbers
O/P is boolean
Left to right associtivity
Has lesser precedence than arithmetic orps
Used with Infix notation

for i = 1; i <= 10; i++
for i = 1; i < 11; i++

[10, 20] closed interval
(30, 45) open interval
[10, 30) Right Open

for i = 10; i <= 20; i++
for i = 31; i < 45; i++
for i = 10; i < 30; i++

SRP

i++;
j--;
a[i] = b[j];
b[j]--;

a[++i] = b[--j]--; // Never code this kind of bulky stmts
----------------------------------------------

Write a program to print the result of the student by taking the average score.
0  - 49 Fail
50 - 74 Second class
74 - 90 FC
91 - 100 D
Also check if the input is invalid

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int averageScore = 0;
    puts("Enter average score of the student to print result");
    scanf("%d", &averageScore);
    if (averageScore >= 0 && averageScore <= 49)
        puts("Fail");
    else if (averageScore <= 74)
        puts("Second Class");
    else if (averageScore <= 90)
        puts("First Class");
    else if (averageScore <= 100)
        puts("Distinction");
    else
        puts("Invalid Input");
}
-----------------------------------------------
Print the Math table of a number for multiples upto 20

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int inputNumber = 0;
    puts("Enter  number to print its Math table");
    scanf("%d", &inputNumber);
    for (int i = 1; i <= 20; i++)
    {
        printf("%2d * %02d = %03d \n", inputNumber, i, inputNumber * i);
    }
}
// 18 * 1 = 18
---------------------------------------------------
